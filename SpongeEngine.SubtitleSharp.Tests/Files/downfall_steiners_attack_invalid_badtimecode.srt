1
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
The enemy has broken through along a wide front.

2
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
They've taken Zossen to the south and are advancing to Stahnsdorf.

3
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
They're on the northern outskirts between Frohnau and Pankow.

4
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
They've reached Lichtenberg, Mahlsdorf and Karlshorst to the east.

5
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
Steiner's assault will bring it under control.

6
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
My Führer...

7
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
Steiner...

8
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
Steiner couldn't mobilize enough men.

9
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
He wasn't able to carry out his assault.

10
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
These men will stay here: Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf.

11
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
That was an order!

12
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
Steiner's assault was an order!

13
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
Who do you think you are to dare disobey an order that I give?

14
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
So this is what it has come to!

15
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
The military has been lying to me.

16
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
Everybody has been lying to me. Even the SS!

17
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
Our generals are just a bunch of contemptible, disloyal cowards.

18
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
I can't permit you to insult the soldiers--

19
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
They are cowards, traitors and failures!

20
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
My Führer, this is outrageous!

21
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
Our generals are the scum of the German people!

22
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
Not a shred of honour!

23
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
They call themselves generals! Years at military academy

24
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
just to learn how to hold a knife and fork!

25
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
For years, the military has hindered my plans!

26
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
They've put every kind of obstacle in my way!

27
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
What I should have done

28
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
is liquidate all the high-ranking officers, as Stalin did!

29
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
I never attended an academy,

30
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
and yet I have conquered Europe all by myself!

31
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
Traitors!

32
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
I've been betrayed and deceived from the very beginning!

33
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
What a monstrous betrayal of the German people.

34
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
But all those traitors will pay.

35
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
They'll pay with their own blood.

36
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
They shall drown in their own blood!

37
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
Gerda, please calm yourself.

38
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
My orders have fallen on deaf ears.

39
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
Under these circumstances, I am no longer able to lead...

40
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
It's over.

41
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
The war is lost.

42
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
But, gentlemen, if you believe I am going to leave Berlin,

43
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
you are seriously mistaken. I'd rather blow my brains out.

44
not_a_timecode --> not_a_timecode
Do whatever you like.
