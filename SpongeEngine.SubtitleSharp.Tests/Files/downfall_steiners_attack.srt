1
00:00:00,265 --> 00:00:03,227
The enemy has broken through along a wide front.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,980
They've taken Zossen to the south and are advancing to Stahnsdorf.

3
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:11,318
They're on the northern outskirts between Frohnau and Pankow.

4
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:15,489
They've reached Lichtenberg, Mahlsdorf and Karlshorst to the east.

5
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:20,744
Steiner's assault will bring it under control.

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,415
My FÃ¼hrer...

7
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:28,126
Steiner...

8
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:33,131
Steiner couldn't mobilize enough men.

9
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:35,842
He wasn't able to carry out his assault.

10
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:58,365
These men will stay here: Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf.

11
00:01:12,462 --> 00:01:14,298
That was an order!

12
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:17,509
Steiner's assault was an order!

13
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:23,098
Who do you think you are to dare disobey an order that I give?

14
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:27,436
So this is what it has come to!

15
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:31,023
The military has been lying to me.

16
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:34,192
Everybody has been lying to me. Even the SS!

17
00:01:34,693 --> 00:01:39,990
Our generals are just a bunch of contemptible, disloyal cowards.

18
00:01:40,157 --> 00:01:42,576
I can't permit you to insult the soldiers--

19
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:45,954
They are cowards, traitors and failures!

20
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:47,914
My FÃ¼hrer, this is outrageous!

21
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:51,668
Our generals are the scum of the German people!

22
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:54,296
Not a shred of honour!

23
00:01:55,756 --> 00:02:00,010
They call themselves generals! Years at military academy

24
00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:03,347
just to learn how to hold a knife and fork!

25
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:07,851
For years, the military has hindered my plans!

26
00:02:08,477 --> 00:02:13,523
They've put every kind of obstacle in my way!

27
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:17,110
What I should have done

28
00:02:17,444 --> 00:02:21,990
is liquidate all the high-ranking officers, as Stalin did!

29
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:29,206
I never attended an academy,

30
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:36,171
and yet I have conquered Europe all by myself!

31
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:42,219
Traitors!

32
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:47,265
I've been betrayed and deceived from the very beginning!

33
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,688
What a monstrous betrayal of the German people.

34
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:55,524
But all those traitors will pay.

35
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:59,444
They'll pay with their own blood.

36
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:02,614
They shall drown in their own blood!

37
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:07,369
Gerda, please calm yourself.

38
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:16,920
My orders have fallen on deaf ears.

39
00:03:18,922 --> 00:03:23,301
Under these circumstances, I am no longer able to lead...

40
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:26,138
It's over.

41
00:03:31,393 --> 00:03:33,729
The war is lost.

42
00:03:40,444 --> 00:03:43,864
But, gentlemen, if you believe I am going to leave Berlin,

43
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,493
you are seriously mistaken. I'd rather blow my brains out.

44
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:55,167
Do whatever you like.
