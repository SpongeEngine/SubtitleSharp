1
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
The enemy has broken through along a wide front.

2
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
They've taken Zossen to the south and are advancing to Stahnsdorf.

3
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
They're on the northern outskirts between Frohnau and Pankow.

4
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
They've reached Lichtenberg, Mahlsdorf and Karlshorst to the east.

5
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
Steiner's assault will bring it under control.

6
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
My FÃ¼hrer...

7
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
Steiner...

8
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
Steiner couldn't mobilize enough men.

9
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
He wasn't able to carry out his assault.

10
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
These men will stay here: Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf.

11
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
That was an order!

12
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
Steiner's assault was an order!

13
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
Who do you think you are to dare disobey an order that I give?

14
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
So this is what it has come to!

15
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
The military has been lying to me.

16
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
Everybody has been lying to me. Even the SS!

17
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
Our generals are just a bunch of contemptible, disloyal cowards.

18
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
I can't permit you to insult the soldiers--

19
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
They are cowards, traitors and failures!

20
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
My FÃ¼hrer, this is outrageous!

21
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
Our generals are the scum of the German people!

22
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
Not a shred of honour!

23
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
They call themselves generals! Years at military academy

24
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
just to learn how to hold a knife and fork!

25
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
For years, the military has hindered my plans!

26
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
They've put every kind of obstacle in my way!

27
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
What I should have done

28
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
is liquidate all the high-ranking officers, as Stalin did!

29
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
I never attended an academy,

30
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
and yet I have conquered Europe all by myself!

31
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
Traitors!

32
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
I've been betrayed and deceived from the very beginning!

33
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
What a monstrous betrayal of the German people.

34
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
But all those traitors will pay.

35
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
They'll pay with their own blood.

36
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
They shall drown in their own blood!

37
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
Gerda, please calm yourself.

38
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
My orders have fallen on deaf ears.

39
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
Under these circumstances, I am no longer able to lead...

40
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
It's over.

41
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
The war is lost.

42
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
But, gentlemen, if you believe I am going to leave Berlin,

43
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
you are seriously mistaken. I'd rather blow my brains out.

44
0:00:00:00.0000000 --> 0:00:00:00.0000000
Do whatever you like.
